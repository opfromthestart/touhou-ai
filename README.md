# touhou-ai
An AI to play bullet hell games like Touhou using pure visual input and reinforcement learning.

It uses `juice` for the neural network, `enigo` for playing the game, `screenshots` to locate the score, and `device_query` for getting input (the last 2 are only needed while training).
Tests are done using NekoProject at its original size (640x400), any resizing may cause incorrect behavior.
