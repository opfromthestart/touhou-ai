# touhou-ai
An AI to play bullet hell games like Touhou using pure visual input and reinforcement learning.

It uses `juice` for the neural network, `enigo` for playing the game, and `screenshots` and `imageproc` to locate the score (this is only needed while training)
Tests are done using NekoProject at its original size, any resizing may cause incorrect behavior.
